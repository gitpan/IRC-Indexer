=head1 NAME

IRC::Indexer::POD::NetworkSpec - Export format for a network

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the format of IRC::Indexer exports from a 
collection of trawlers composing an IRC network.

This is the data returned by L<IRC::Indexer::Report::Network> after it has 
been fed at least one L<IRC::Indexer::Report::Server>.

You'll probably want to read L<IRC::Indexer::POD::ServerSpec> -- the 
same conventions apply.

=head1 HASH KEYS

  ConnectedAt => TIME
  FinishedAt  => TIME
  
  GlobalUsers => INT
  OperCount   => INT

  Servers     => HASH   (see below)
  LastServer  => STRING (last server trawled for this network)

  ChanCount   => INT  (public channels only)  
  HashChans   => HASH
  ListChans   => ARRAY

These are documented further in L<IRC::Indexer::POD::ServerSpec>.

=head2 Servers hash

  Servers => {
    SERVER-NAME => {
      TrawledAt => TIME
      IRCD => STRING (server version)
      MOTD => [ ARRAY of MOTD lines ]  ## OPTIONAL
    }
  }

The B<Servers> hash contains information pertaining to specific servers 
belonging to this network that have been trawled.

It is keyed on actual reported server name (the ServerName field of a 
Server export); each server is a nested hash.
